I have worked with React, React Native, Node.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL for data management. I utilize Docker to create standardized development environments, facilitate container versioning, and ensure scalability of applications across different environments (development, staging, and production). I am passionate about technology and constantly seek continuous learning and innovation."
